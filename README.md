# Hotel Quimbaya Server

Welcome to the Hotel Quimbaya Server repository! This repository contains the backend source code of an application developed in Node.js.

## Project description

Hotel Quimbaya Server is a backend developed in Node.js that provides an API to interact with a web application. The goal of this project is to manage and process client requests, handle business logic and database interaction.

## Technologies used

The project has been developed using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: It is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows the creation of server applications. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model, which makes it efficient and scalable.

- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that facilitates the development of APIs and web applications. It provides a simple and robust way to handle HTTP requests, define routes and manage middleware.

- **MongoDB**: It is a widely used NoSQL database that is based on documents. It provides flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for modern applications.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `controllers/`: This folder contains the application drivers, which handle business logic and database interactions.

- `models/`: Here you will find the data models that represent the database entities and structures.

- routes/`: In this folder you will find the definitions of the API routes, which specify how HTTP requests should be handled.

- config/`: Here you can find the application configuration files.

- middlewares/`: This folder contains the middlewares used in the application to perform tasks such as authentication, data validation, etc.

- index.js/`: This file is the entry point of the application, where the server is configured and started.

- `package.json/`: This file contains the project dependencies and other related metadata.

- `README.md`: This file, which you are currently reading, provides general information about the repository.
